This is the first of a series of two blog posts.  Recently, I applied to join Sandbox, a community of innovators who are under 30 (check them out here: http://sandbox.is/).  One of the questions asked about the values that I lived by and why.  I really liked my response, that I decided to make a blog post about it!

#### Value 1: “Compound interest is the most powerful force in the world.”

If you can invest carefully and early, you can reap large rewards over time. This isn’t just related to money: This is an ethos for  how I define my life. I strive to invest in things that are going to pay off well for me in the future. I invest in my health by exercising every day and eating healthy so that I will have a healthy body in old age. I invest time and energy in learning computer science to build the foundation for a meaningful career. I invest my time knocking on doors for political candidates I support with the hopes of seeing a more just and stable United States. I invest in the people I care about, so that I may have lifelong friendships.  
  
#### Value 2:” Learn from your near misses, not just your mistakes.”

My last final in college was for my differential equations class.  Taking that class was like drinking out of a fire hose. I knew that I wasn’t going to fail the class, no matter how badly I did on my final. But I also wanted to get at least a B on the exam. Regretfully, this anxiety drove me to cheat on the exam. I put formulas down in my calculator that I shouldn’t have had. One of my classmates walked past me to the professor to turn her exam in. I saw her eyes look down at my formulas. I instantly froze up in fear. This was the last final of my entire college career. And here I was, about to blow it all.  
  
But she didn’t notice anything. Or, if she did, she took mercy on me and didn’t tell the professor. This is one example among many where I’ve dodged a bullet that I should have taken. I regret my actions. But I made it a point to learn from that mistake, even though I didn’t get caught. So, after that incident, one of my guiding principles has been to be aware of the mistakes that I make. And to learn from them, even if I didn’t pay any consequences. For this case, I reflected deeply on my academic anxiety and standards of morality. I decided that I wouldn’t let any external indicator of my worth compel me to do what I felt to be wrong.  
  
#### Value 3: “As long as you are course correcting, you are fine.”

A year ago, when I had started a new job, I had a nervous breakdown on the subway. I was a mess, struggling with starting a new job, drug addiction, shitty roommates, and heartbreak. I was angry at myself for the situation that I put myself in. And scared that I may not be okay.  
  
Something I had to tell myself is that experiencing hardships and making mistakes is all part of the human condition. There’s no avoiding it. You can’t escape the basic nature of being an imperfect human who is always learning through experience. However, what you can do is stop thinking dramatically about “why is this happening to me?”, and instead think about “what can I learn from this?” That has been the difference for me. I have the ability to learn from my mistakes and to analyze the reasons why I made them. I use this information to make tweaks in my life.  
  
To continue with my story, eventually I got a therapist. I thought about the situation, and I was not happy with the path that I was going down. I felt like finding a therapist would put me back on track to becoming the best possible self that I can be. I learned that I didn’t have to worry about whether I was doing a good job or not, or if I was okay, because every day offers a new chance to change.
