This is the second of a series of two blog posts.  Recently, I applied to join Sandbox, a community of innovators who are under 30 (check them out here: http://sandbox.is/).  One of the questions asked about which fictional character best represents my story and why.  I really liked my response, that I decided to make a blog post about it!

If I was a fictional character, I would be the Protagonist (unnamed) from Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the Universe, by Haruki Murakami.  

The protagonist from the book is incredibly complex and intricate, so I won’t go into too much detail.  But at the end of the book, the protagonist had a choice.  He could either spend the rest of eternity living in a village, or living in the woods outside of the village.

If he were to live in the village, he would live a peaceful life in nirvana.  Free of suffering.  However, if he did this, he would lose all identity of himself.  Of his past.  Of the concept of being.  However, if the protagonist decided to stay in the woods, he would be able to piece back the fragments of his identity.  He would have an understanding of the concept of self.  By choosing to stay in the woods, the protagonist decides to rebel against a corporate system that transmogrified his existence.  

The theme of the book is the struggle between individualism and corporate identity.  I have felt this tension my entire life.  Institutions and systems are difficult for me.  I am a rebel at heart, and I always want to live life on my own terms. This was apparent at a young age when I would skip school to make music and skateboard with my friends.  But this tension of being stuck between individualism and corporate collectivism, hit me the hardest in the summer of 2018.

I was living in Boston and working at a job that I was not happy with; doing software engineering for a startup building productivity software.  I felt like that in order to participate in modern society, I had to fit into a pre-described role for me.  I had to let go of my individuality and simply accept the corporate takeover of my life.  And in return, I could have a cushy upper middle class lifestyle, free of uncertainties and difficulties.

This point in the road to me felt similar to the protagonist in Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World.  He had the choice to retire in the village, free of discomforts, but also of his identity.  However, he chose to stay in the woods.  Even if that was harder, he still had his sense of self.  His memories.  His dreams and hopes and worries.

So I decided not to stay in the village.  I quit my job, spent the summer backpacking Europe alone, and moved to New York City that fall.  It was the best thing that I could have done.  Just like the protagonist, I put myself in the woods.  And this has been the philosophy that I’ve followed ever since.  Never let a job, or a school, or any institution ever take over your life.  Even if it means living with uncertainty and chaos.  Your identity, and self value is so much more important.
