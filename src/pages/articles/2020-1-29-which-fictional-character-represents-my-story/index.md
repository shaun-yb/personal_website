This is the second of a series of two blog posts.  Recently, I applied to join Sandbox, a community of innovators who are under 30 (check them out here: http://sandbox.is/).  One of the questions asked about which fictional character best represents my story and why.  I really liked my response, that I decided to make a blog post about it!
