During an interview, I was onced asked what was the difference between being a junior software engineer and being a mid level software engineer.

As I recalled of my own career progression, I thought of many things that differentiated my time from a junior software engineer to a mid level engineer.  A few things came in mind.  There was technical aspecs; e.g. being able to write modular, well tested code.  Understanding and being able to apply topics in computer science.  Leading projects from requirements gathering to deployment.  There were also some non technical skills that came to mind.  Being able to work with stakeholders such as product managers.  Being able to make well defined estimations.  Writing documentation and specs.

Out of all of these responsibilities, one came to mind as far as being the most important skill to develop as a mid level engineer, and that is mentoring junior developers.  You see, advanced development isn’t an individual activity; it’s a team sport.  It requires you to be able to support and mentor the developers on your team; especially those who are less experienced than you.  I’ve been very fortunate to have had many mentors in my life.  When thinking of mentors in my life, one person comes to mind who mentored me at Yesware.  She took me under her wing per se.  She tutored me in technical concepts such as writing tests in JavaScript to helping me break down large tasks into several pull requests.  She also helped me figure out how to deal with difficult situations involving friction between me and my team members and how to navigate office politics.  In some ways, I credit her with saving my career.

At my last job, I was fortunate enough to have had the chance to mentor a junior developer.  It was my first time being on the other side of the table; being the mentor rather than the mentee.  I learned a lot mentoring her.  Being able have had both perspectives has taught me a lot about mentorship.  I wanted to document some of the lessons I have had learned through my experience in being a mentor, and being mentored, in the hope that it will help me and others become better mentors.

## Before you are friends with your mentee, you are colleagues.

You can say this with any relationship with anyone you work with.  The tech industry has a way of fuzzying your professional life with your work life.  When you spend time playing Super Smash Brothers with your coworkers for hours, or get drunk together at the in office bar, it’s easy for the line between someone being your colleage and someone being your friend to get blurry.

I met my mentor before I started my job.  I was part of a Slack group that had a Slack bot that randomly matched two people together to get coffee every other week.  The two of us were matched and we met in a hole in the wall cafe in the East Village.  When we talked about ourselves, it had turned out that coincidentally she had started interning at the company that I was about to join.

This was obviously extremely exciting, and we bonded as friends before we started the job.  So in a way, we started our relationship off as friends, rather than colleagues.  Within a week of working together, she asked me to provide more formal mentorship to her, for which I agreed.

Being friends with your colleagues can lead to dangerous situations.  At the end of the day, the definition of a business is a group of people collectively organized to meet the goals of the organization, ultimately to generate profit.  The relationships between you and your coworkers should be conducted in a manner that will help the business reach these goals.  When the relationship between your coworkers is not conducted in this manner, it is a distraction from meeting the objectives that you signed up for when taking a job at a for profit company.  This can lead you to behave in manners that are detremental to the business.  Which leads me to my second lesson…

## You need to be brutally honest with your mentee.

Over the course of a few months at my job, I saw that my mentee was stuggling.  She was having communication issues with her manager.  I had also been reviewing her pull requests, and I did not think that they were at the technical rigor that I would expect for someone at this point in their career.

What did I do about it?  Nothing really.  Since I had been treating her as my friend first, and then colleague, I was afraid to give her honest feedback and suggestions.  I have a hard time doing this with my friends for trivial stuff such as dating, so you can imagine how difficult it would be for me to give criticism for something non trivial such as work performance.

This was ultimtely a disservice for her and for the company.  By not being more upfront with how I felt, she continued to struggle more and more.  And fall more and more behind.  This was taking a toll on her well being, as she was very stressed out on a daily basis.

I thought about my old mentor at Yesware.  When she was able to give me honest feedback, it actually saved my career.  I became aware of my blindspots; the things that I needed to improve on, but wasn’t able to see for myself.  I evetually had a candid conversation with my mentee.  I told her that I was concerned about her performance at the job.  I told her that I thought she was absolutely capable of doing the work (she’s an absolute genius fwiw).  I was just concerned about the position she was in.  So together, we brainstormed some classes she could take to improve some of her technical blindspots.  I also helped her switch teams to a new manager.

Now, she is a lot happier, and I am proud to say that the quality of her code has improved exponentially.  While I can’t take credit for her improvements, I do like to think I was instrumental in providing her the direction she needed to get on the right path.

## Seek out mentorship on how to be a better mentor yourself

Mentorship isn’t something that’s taught in a computer science major’s coursework.  It’s something that you need to develop on your own.  You’re never going to get everything right.  It’s a bit daunting.  If you make a mistake in writing your code, most times at the very worst you can rollback a deploy and fix the bug.  But with mentoring, someone’s career is on the line.  You can’t rollback advice or guidance that you give them as easily.  And by pointing them in the wrong direction, in the worse case scenerio, it could cost them their job.

So seek out mentorship on how to be a better mentor.  Talk to your manager about it.  If you already have a mentor, ask them for their advice on mentorship.  Read articles (such as this one!) on how to be a good mentor.  Rands (https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/), a Slack group on engineering leadership, is also a great resource.  Never stop seeking out how to be a better mentor.

## Lead by Example

This might be the most important lesson that I have learned in being a mentor.  Your mentee is looking up to you; otherwise, they wouldn’t have picked you as a mentor.  You can give them all of the advice in the world, but the best way to teach them is to lead by example.  Think about the things that you want them to do, and do them yourself.  Tag them in your pull requests.  Take on leadership and extra initiatives in your company.  Interact with others the way you think they should be interacting with their colleagues.  This has a double whammy of  also helping you be a better employee.

So there you have it!  These are a few tips that I have learned in being a mentor, and being mentored.  I will continue to add to this list as I learn more, but in the menatime, please feel free to contact me with any feedback, or things that you’ve learned being a mentor or mentee.
