[Joshua Weltz](http://ecotheory.biology.gatech.edu/), a quantative biology professor at Georgia Tech, came up with a [formula](https://figshare.com/articles/COVID-19_Event_Risk_Assessment_Planner/11965533) to calculate the chance that within a country, at a given event of X size, there is at least one infected individual.  This formula can be written as: 

`risk(g,p,i) = 1 -(1-(i/p))^g`

Where `g` is the group size at the event, `i` is the number of infected individuals in the population, and `p` is the total size of the calculation.
