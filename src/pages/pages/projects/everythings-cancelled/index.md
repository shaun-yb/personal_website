Like many people, my sense of normality has been torn underneath my feet like a rug in response to the Coronavirus.  On March 9, 2020, I flew to Puerto Rico to celebrate getting my job offer at YvesBlue.  While I was there, things kept getting weirder and weirder.  Schools were shutting down.  Borders were closing.  Basic household necesaties(sp) were in shortage.  These were ombious signs for what was to come.

I knew that sh*t was about to hit the fan.  And that if I were to start a new job remotely, also in the midst of a pandemic, Puerto Rico would be the worse place for me to be.  I didn't want to get stuck on the island, so I took the next plane back to the mainland, where I am now at my parents' house in Maine weathering out this pandemic.

Something struck me about being in Puerto Rico.  I was staying in a hostel in Ocean Park and met travelers from all around the world.  Instead of the usual "where are you from", or "what do you do" questions i usually hear in hostel, everyone was talking about nothing but the coronavirus.  Yet, none of us were practicing social distancing.  We were dozens of 20-something year olds sleeping on top of each other, sharing a communal bathroom and kitchen.  There's no better conditions for virus transmission.

Looking back, it makes me extremely concerned how disconcerned people were about staying home and isolated.  I don't think any of these people are bad people.  I don't think any sane person would willingly want to infect someone else.  The problem is that many people don't realize how much of an impact their choices can make.

One way of distilling this information that has been helpful has been the #flattenthecurve campaign.  The #flattenthecurve campaign lays out an infection curve under different circumstances.  In one circumstance, the curve is shorter but has a high peak; this is without any social isolation.  In the second circumstance, the curve stretches out longer on the X-axis, but it doesn't spike on the Y.

I have been inspired by the impact the #flattenthecurve movement has been.  So I want to add onto that.  I want to create a series of interactive data visualization tools for users to measure how much their social behavior impacts the tragectory of a virus outbreak.  We need make sure that, whether it be a concert, wedding, or party, **EVERYTHING'S CANCELLED**!

The two tools in development at the moment are:
- [Corona SIR Model](https://shauncar.land/projects/everythings-cancelled/coronavirus-sir-modeling)
- [Event Risk Assessment](https://shauncar.land/projects/everythings-cancelled/event-risk-assessment)

Technically speaking, all of the code is in the Everything's Cancelled [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/everythings-cancelled).  So far, each tool consists of two different parts: a sinatra backed API and a react frontend component.

Eventaully, I want to implement `everythingscancelled.com` that can toggle between all of the different tools.
