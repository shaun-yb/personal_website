ðŸ‘‹ Hello!


My name is Shaun (although you probably know that about me already, if you're reading this). Growing up in a small town you probably haven't heard of [a small town you probably haven't heard of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapleigh,_Maine) in Maine, I spent my childhood hiking the Appalachian mountains, picking wild berries, partaking in philosophical discussions with trees, and swimming in the Atlantic year round.  I received my Bachelors of Arts in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Southern Maine in 2015.  During my time in college, I founded Divest Maine;  a coalition of students, staff, faculty, and alumni at the University of Maine System dedicated to campaigning the University's to divest its holdings from fossil fuel investments in its endowment.  The campaign lead to the University  [divesting its holdings from coal](https://gofossilfree.org/usa/university-of-maine-system-divests-from-coal-announces-full-divestment-of-umpi-foundation/); becoming the first public state university system in the country to do so.

Post college, I spent four years working as a software engineer at various companies in Boston and New York City.  I was able to learn a lot and meet cool people, but I wasn't happy because I couldn't see how my work was making the world a better place, in the same way that my activism around fossil fuel divestment did.  That is, until I found my current job at YvesBlue.

[YvesBlue](http://yves.blue) is a Financial Technology startup located in NYC.  We are building analytical tools for financial analysts to use to gain insights on Environmental, Societal, and Governance (ESG) metrics for thousands of publically traded companies.  This allows analysts to invest their money into sustainable companies, organizations, and funds to not only gain a financial return on their capital - but also to generage measurable and beneficial environemtnal and/or social impact.

My primary challenges at YvesBlue revolve around constructing constructive simple, elegant solutions to complex problems. I strive for well designed code, and while I cannot say I always succeed, my work is consistently improved by the humble attempt.  I am beyond fortunate to wake up everyday, doing the work that I love, knowing I'm making the world a better place.

I enjoy mentoring ambitious, motivated developers and I am always open to networking with individuals both in and out of the technology industry.  So if you ever wanna chat about programming, traveling, music, or whatever else, feel free to hit me up!
