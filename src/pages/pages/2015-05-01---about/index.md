ðŸ‘‹Hello!

My name is Shaun (although you problaby know that about me already, if you're reading this).  

 Growing up in a small town you probably haven't heard of [a small town you probably haven't heard of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapleigh,_Maine) in Maine, I spent my childhood hiking the Appalachian mountains, picking wild berries, partaking in philosophical discussions with trees, and swimming in the Atlantic year round

I received my Bachelors of Arts in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Southern Maine in 2015.  During my time in college, I founded Divest Maine;  a coalition of students, staff, faculty, and alumni at the University of Maine System dedicated to campaigning the University's to divest its holdings from fossil fuel investments in its endowment.  The campaign lead to the University  [divesting its holdings from coal](https://gofossilfree.org/usa/university-of-maine-system-divests-from-coal-announces-full-divestment-of-umpi-foundation/) ; becoming the first public state university system in the country to do so .  I also spent a summer biking over 1200 miles, visiting communities along the coast of Maine raising climate change awareness.

Post college, I have spent the last four years working professionally as a software engineer.  Two things interest me the most about software engineering:

- Finding simple, elegant solutions to complex problems.  I strive for well designed code, and while I cannot say I always succeed, my work is consistently improved by the humble attempt.

- Optimizing pre-existing code.  I enjoy being able to get my hands dirty in a new code base, and massage the code to reduce the number of CPU cycles required to complete a task.

Beyond writing code, two of my biggest passions are music and traveling.  I have been playing classical piano for over 10 years, and I have been writing/composing my own music for seven.  I have been fortunate to have visited over 20 countries (USA, Canada, Iceland, England, France, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Colombia, South Africa, Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Hungary, Scotland, Mexico, and South Korea).  Being able to be exposed to different cultures and different ways of living has enriched my day to day life.

I enjoy mentoring ambitious, motivated developers and I am always open to networking with individuals both in and out of the technology industry in New York City.  So if you ever wanna grab a coffee, talk about technology/music/traveling/opportunities, please get in touch with me! :)
