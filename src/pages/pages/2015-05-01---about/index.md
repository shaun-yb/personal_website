ðŸ‘‹Hello!

My name is Shaun (although you problaby know that about me already, if you're reading this).  Currently, I am the lead backend engineer at [YvesBlue](http://yves.blue), a Financial Technology startup in NYC that builds software to allow investors how sustainable and impactful their portfolios are.

Growing up in a small town you probably haven't heard of [a small town you probably haven't heard of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapleigh,_Maine) in Maine, I spent my childhood hiking the Appalachian mountains, picking wild berries, partaking in philosophical discussions with trees, and swimming in the Atlantic year round.

I received my Bachelors of Arts in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Southern Maine in 2015.  During my time in college, I founded Divest Maine;  a coalition of students, staff, faculty, and alumni at the University of Maine System dedicated to campaigning the University's to divest its holdings from fossil fuel investments in its endowment.  The campaign lead to the University  [divesting its holdings from coal](https://gofossilfree.org/usa/university-of-maine-system-divests-from-coal-announces-full-divestment-of-umpi-foundation/); becoming the first public state university system in the country to do so .  I also spent a summer biking over 1200 miles, visiting communities along the coast of Maine raising climate change awareness.

Post college, I have spent the last four years working professionally as a software engineer.  Two things interest me the most about software engineering:

- Finding simple, elegant solutions to complex problems.  I strive for well designed code, and while I cannot say I always succeed, my work is consistently improved by the humble attempt.

- Optimizing pre-existing code.  I enjoy being able to get my hands dirty in a new code base, and massage the code to reduce the number of CPU cycles required to complete a task.

At the moment, I am currently living in Denver, CO; soaking up the mountains in my rare moments of not coding.  I have also lived in Portland (ME), Boston, and New York City.  Beyond my native country (USA) I have had the fortune to have stayed time in:

- Canada
- Iceland
- UK
- France
- Japan
- Denmark
- Sweden
- Germany
- Colombia
- South Africa
- The Netherlands
- Spain
- Italy
- Croatia
- Montenegro
- Bosnia & Herzegovina
- Hungary
- South Korea
- Morocco

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing me to flee NYC, I have decided to become a 100% remote developer and embrace a digital nomad lifestyle - one where I can combine my love of traveling and my passion of programming together.

I enjoy mentoring ambitious, motivated developers and I am always open to networking with individuals both in and out of the technology industry.  So if you ever wanna chat about programming, traveling, music, or whatever else, feel free to hit me up!
